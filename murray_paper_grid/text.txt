I think the issue here is that the bee 'swarm' we're trying to work with
doesn't really work like a traditional robotic swarm, in which you provide goals that need to be
accomplished as a cohesive unit (akin to centralised swarms).
Rather, each bee is an independent robot that also operates independently until it is recruited.

So I feel like for this, rather than focusing on decomposition, we should look at the interaction between the bees.
The bees are triggered by an event (either proximity to another bee, or to the foraging site) which changes their state.
And during the trigger, the bees either synchronise with the other bee or internally.
